## Discover how Web Scraping can help your digital strategy

Most stats students want to enter data science world because they want to work with sports, me inclueded, but I thought in give a search in how we could use one of the tools I learned in class in a area I was not familiar with, so I decided to go to digital startegy since this is my weakest area of knowledge and see what I could learn from it and share it with you all.

Web Scraping can be very useful for any digital strategy. In fact, this practice is more common than you might think, and you may have even used some form of it before.

By analyzing other web pages, you can find many valuable ideas for your own digital strategy and make small improvements that result in significant benefits. Here are some of the main benefits:

 #### 1-Generate valuable business ideas

Data collection would be useless if it didn't bring valuable insights and ideas that can be applied in the day-to-day operation of the business.

But when you analyze what works (or doesn't) on other sites and compare it to what you've been doing in your own strategy, it's easier to make decisions and promote changes that improve your performance and results.

#### 2-Validate hypotheses and debunk myths

It is very common to see assertions that are taken as truth but have never been proven with data.

In these cases, evaluating the results that others have achieved can help you debunk myths and validate hypotheses accurately.

For example, does certain words in a post title really increase its click-through rate? Or do certain writing techniques promote better engagement?

This type of information is easily accessible with Web Scraping.

#### 3-Save time and effort

The same extraction work that would take you weeks or even months to complete can be done by bots in a few hours or days.

This makes time savings one of the great advantages of this approach instead of collecting information manually.

Moreover, the accuracy of bots is higher because they do not face distractions and concerns like humans, nor do they need to deal with numerous variables, like us, in our daily lives.

#### 4-Collect data from accurate sources

Many of the market research reports you have access to are outdated by a few years? Only a small portion of the data applies specifically to the segment you operate in?

This type of problem, although decreasing more and more, is still common. With Web Scraping, you know well the sources you will examine and can choose only sites directly related to your industry.

This increases the accuracy of the evaluations and, in turn, the chances of you finding good information to use in the strategy.

#### 5-Perform specific tasks

At the beginning of this topic, I talked about how Web Scraping can be more common than you think, and that your company may already make use of it.

This is because many of today's marketing tools, such as SEMRush, Buzzsumo, Ahrefs, SimilarWeb, Hunter.io, and others, are basically extraction resources.

They examine data from web pages and offer important information about them, such as traffic data, backlinks, content engagement, contact information, etc.

This shows how relevant the practice is for performing specific tasks, such as discovering good guest post partners, what topics to talk about on your blog, or even discovering the email of a potential partner.

## Precautions you need to take when applying Web Scraping to your strategy

Now we need to talk about the ethical and legal limits of Web Scraping. First of all, it must be said that the practice is not illegal in itself.

But, in some cases, there are barriers that you need to worry about so as not to act wrongly and suffer negative consequences.

The fact is that many websites have specific policies and actions to prohibit or hinder data mining. Here are the main points of attention and how to act with each of them:

- **robots.txt**: This file may contain restrictions on what can be mined or not. Respect its limitations to avoid bad consequences;
- **terms of service**: Thinking that the terms of service do not apply to this case is not entirely true. If someone complains in court, the claims of these terms may be valid;
- **laws of the location where the site is hosted**: If the site is hosted in another country, you need to be extra careful not to infringe local data protection laws;
- **crawl rate**: The faster the bots work, the more accesses to the server. Also, the greater the chance of the site realizing this as an attack. Go easy on the extraction pace;
- **Scraper identification**: Creating an identification file for your Scraper, indicating who you are and how you will use the data, is a good practice that can avoid problems;
- **protection of collected data**: If the data you want to use is protected by copyright, it's better not to collect it.

## How to apply Web Scraping: 4 simple steps

#### 1-Find the right tools

If you are a stats student you should know (or will) how to use python to do the web scraping. But I would like to show you some other alternatives for those that don;t know how to program or just don;t want to.

There are many Web Scraping tools, both free and paid. Here I won't focus on tools that perform specific tasks, such as the ones mentioned above.

The focus will be on those that allow for a more "artisanal" and personalized process, which you can shape as you prefer. Here are some good options:

- [Webscraper.io](https://webscraper.io/): It offers two options, a free extension for Chrome and a complete cloud-based extraction tool;
- [Import.io](Import.io): paid subscription with good options.

#### 2-Identify the sites you want to analyze

After choosing your tool, just choose which site you want to analyze and start setting it up according to the tool's parameters.

Webscraper, mentioned above, requires no knowledge of code, as it is a completely visual tool.

This way, you can quickly configure everything you want to collect. After that, just let the bot do its job and wait for the next step, which we'll see now.

#### 3-Save the data

 When you have the data, just export to a place where you can do the analysis, very common is to use excel, but other options like mysql is also valid.

#### 4-Analyze the information in search of what you want

Last but not least, it's time to analyze the data and find the patterns they indicate.

This is the moment to understand what your competitors do well, how this can be used in your strategy, and many other relevant details.

Then, just repeat the process with as many sites as you want and compare them with your own results to draw new insights and improve your marketing constantly.

Web Scraping is an old and widely used tactic, but it still goes unnoticed by many professionals, even the most experienced ones.

Although it requires some care, this data extraction technique can transform your digital strategy and increase your productivity, without much effort.

### Conclusion

Web Scrapping is amazing and it can be applied in any field, my recommendation is to study it well, look for areas where it's used and you are not very familiar with like for me was digital strategy and I promise you won't regret it, because the greatest ideas come from unexpected places.
